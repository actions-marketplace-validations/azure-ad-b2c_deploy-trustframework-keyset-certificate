# GitHub Action for deploying TrustFramework KeySet certificates

Use this GitHub Action to deploy a TrustFramework KeySet certificate into your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant using the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/trustframeworkkeyset?view=graph-rest-beta). If the certificate does not yet exist, it will be created. If the certificate already exists, it will be replaced with a new version.

For more information on TrustFramework Policies and the Identity Experience Framework, see the [Azure AD B2C documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-overview).

To authenticate to the Microsoft Graph, you will need to obtain client application credentials using [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/microsoft-graph-get-started).
